# Online Retail Application Database 🛒

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive relational database design and implementation for an **Online Retail Application**. Developed as a team project for the **Database Systems** course, the system aims to streamline retail operations by managing products, customers, orders, employees, and logistics within a unified and integrity-driven data environment.

## 🏗️ Design & Architecture
The database was architected through a rigorous engineering lifecycle to ensure scalability and data consistency:

* **Requirement Analysis:** Identified 10 core entities (Products, Customers, Orders, Reviews, Shipping, Payments, Employees, etc.) to support a full e-commerce ecosystem.
* **ERM & Schema Design:** * Developed a detailed **Entity-Relationship Model (ERM)** using Visual Paradigm.
  * Defined primary and foreign key constraints to maintain strict referential integrity.
* **Database Normalization:** * Applied normalization theory systematically from **1NF to 3NF**.
  * Successfully eliminated data redundancies and update anomalies, ensuring an optimized storage structure.

## 🛠️ Implementation & SQL Highlights
The project documentation includes complete SQL logic for:
* **Data Definition (DDL):** Structured table creation scripts with defined data types and constraints.
* **Complex Data Retrieval:** Advanced SQL queries utilizing **Joins, Subqueries, and Aggregate functions** for business reporting.
* **Database Views:** Implementation of specialized views such as:
  * `OrderSummaryView`: For quick financial overviews.
  * `CustomerOrderView`: To track customer purchase history.
  * `HighRatedProductsView`: For marketing and inventory insights.

## 💻 Tech Stack
* **Language:** SQL
* **Modeling Tools:** Visual Paradigm (ERM), drawSQL (Relational Schema).
* **Concepts:** Relational Database Management, Normalization (3NF), Data Integrity.

## 📂 Repository Contents
* **[📂 Databases_Project.pdf](./Databases_Project.pdf)**: The full technical presentation and report containing ER diagrams, normalization steps, and the complete SQL source scripts.
